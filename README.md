Ali's Fris√∂rSalong website

Developed By Ahmet and Elvis as part of Exjobb

!! Currently ongoing progress !!

1. We took the offer from a close friend of ours to build him a website for his salong where he wanted his customers to be able to
  register through his website so we cud have a better check and understanding of who is gonna come at what time. though this is rather a simple projket the hard part is that we have no backend experience, so the booking system can take some time to pull it off, but in the other side we hare trying our hardest as a frontend developer to make it possible and this is something we will learn alot from both in experience with coding and meetings and how the world around the web/client works.

UPDATE

1. we have come a long way with the client side all that remains is a functionell booking-system as we expected would take alot of time as it needs some backend development, hopefully we can atleast make it a good root for the booking-system and continue develop it in the future to make it as functionell as possible.
